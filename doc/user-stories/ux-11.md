# UX-11

## URL Submission and Analysis
### Story: 
> As a system, I want to have Selenium WebDriver installed and configured so that I can automate browser interactions for website scraping.

### Assumptions/Preconditions
- The application is built using .NET.  
- The system needs to support Selenium WebDriver integration.
- Supported browsers include Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

### Description
Setting up Selenium WebDriver should be seamless and intuitive. The system should be configured to interact with web browsers automatically, allowing smooth and error-free webpage navigation. This feature is designed to support automation, ensuring that websites can be accessed, rendered, and processed without requiring extensive manual intervention.

The Selenium setup process will ensure that the system can reliably launch a browser, navigate to a webpage, and handle any navigation issues that may arise. This setup will be optimized for performance, ensuring minimal delays in execution.

Here are the implementation details we've settled on after discussions with the development team:
- Supports Chrome, Edge, or Firefox: The system will use Selenium WebDriver to open and render pages in these browsers.
- Handles page navigation: The system should be able to access a given URL and ensure the page loads completely.
- Manages timeouts and errors: If a webpage takes too long to load, fails to respond, or returns an invalid URL error, the system should handle these issues gracefully without crashing.
- Optimized for performance: The WebDriver should initialize quickly and execute efficiently, ensuring smooth automation.

### Acceptance Criteria:
**Given** the system has Selenium installed and configured,
**Then** I will be able to launch a browser session using WebDriver,   
**And** the system will be able to load a provided URL without errors,   
**And** the browser should wait for the page to fully load before performing any actions.   

**Given** a webpage takes too long to load, fails to respond, or contains an invalid URL,   
**Then** the system should detect the issue and log an appropriate error message,   
**And** it should attempt to retry or exit gracefully,    
**And** the failure should not crash the application.

**Given** the system has successfully loaded a webpage,   
**Then** it should be able to interact with page elements dynamically,   
**And** JavaScript-based content should be rendered properly,  
**And** lazy-loaded elements should be detected and processed.   

**Given** the system needs to support multiple browsers,   
**Then** the WebDriver should be able to launch Chrome, Edge, and Firefox,   
**And** it should select the appropriate driver for the requested browser,   
**And** it should manage browser sessions efficiently to avoid unnecessary resource consumption.   

**Given** the system encounters an issue with Selenium WebDriver,  
**Then** it should handle WebDriver-related failures gracefully,  
**And** provide clear error messages for debugging,   
**And** ensure logging captures useful information to diagnose problems.    

### Tasks

- Install Selenium WebDriver for .NET via NuGet.
- Install necessary browser drivers (ChromeDriver, EdgeDriver, GeckoDriver for Firefox).
- Write jest tests
- Write unit tests
- Write moq tests
- Write Specflow tests
- Create a WebScraperService class to manage browser interactions.
- Implement a method to accept a URL and navigate to the webpage.
    - Add error handling for:
    - Invalid URLs.
    - Page load timeouts.
    - Selenium WebDriver failures.
    - Websites blocking automated scraping.
- Validate that the browser can launch and load web pages.
