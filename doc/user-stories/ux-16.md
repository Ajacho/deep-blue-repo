## Report Generation
### Story: 
> As a user, I want to view the results of the analysis so that I know how to improve it.

### Assumptions/Preconditions
- The analysis results have been successfully stored in a database and are accessible via an API.
- The user has the necessary permissions to view the analysis results.
### Description
Once the system completes the accessibility and UX analysis, the user should be able to view a detailed description of the report. The report should include a summary of findings, categorized issues, and actionable recommendations for improvement. The data should be presented in a user-friendly format, ensuring the user can easily navigate through and comprehend the results.
### Acceptance Criteria:
**Given** I am a logged-in user with access to reports   
**Then** I will see a page/button titled “Analysis results”   
**And** I will see a brief summary of website’s accessibility and UX status   
**And** I will see a “last analyzed date” indicating when the analysis was performed   

**Given** the analysis has identified website issues   
**Then** I will see three primary sections in the report: Accessibility issues, UX issues, and actionable (mockups) recommendations.   
**And** each sections will collapsible/expandable for better understanding and readability   
**And** each issue will have: title, description, severity level, list of affected elements, mockups, step-by-step recommendations   

**Given** my website has no detected issues   
**Then** I will see a message in bold stating “Congrats! No issues detected. Your site is in great shape!”   

**Given** I am reviewing the report analysis results   
**Then** I will see a sidebar navigation menu links to: overview, accessibility issues, UX issues,    
**Then** I should be able to do so using intuitive UI elements   

**Given** my website has no detected issues   
**When** I view the report   
**Then** I should see a message stating, "No issues detected. Your site is in great shape!"   

**Given** I am not logged in    
**Then** I will not be able to access the report   
**And** I will be redirected to the login page   

**Given** I am logged in but do not have permission to view the report   
**Then** I will see an “Access denied” message   
**And** I will not be able to see any report content   

**Given** I am an authorized user   
**Then** my report will load securely via an API request   
**And** the report data will not be cached on the client side for security reasons   

**Given** my report contains a large dataset  
**Then** the page will load within 3 seconds   
**And** I will see a loading indicator while the data is being fetched   
**And** the system will use lazy loading to handle lists efficiently    

**Given** I resize my browser window   
**Then** the UI element will adjust dynamically without breaking layout   

**Given** I need to share my report externally   
**Then** I will see an option to export the report as a PDF or CSV    
**And** the exported file will maintain the same structured format   
### Tasks
