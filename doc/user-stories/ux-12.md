## URL Submission and Analysis
### Story: 
> As a system, I want to capture full-page website screenshots using Selenium so that I can visually analyze the structure and layout of web pages.

### Assumptions/Preconditions
- Selenium WebDriver is installed and configured.
- The system can successfully open and navigate to web pages.
- Screenshots should capture full-page content, including dynamic elements.
### Description
Capturing a visual representation of a website should be seamless and intuitive. The system should allow automated full-page screenshots of websites without requiring extensive setup or manual intervention. This feature is designed to ensure accurate representation, even for dynamic web pages that load content via JavaScript or scrolling.

The screenshot capture process will be fully automated using Selenium WebDriver, ensuring that pages are rendered correctly before capturing. Screenshots should include all visible elements and be saved efficiently for future analysis.

Here are the implementation details we've settled on after discussions with the development team:
- Supports Chrome, Edge, or Firefox: The system will use Selenium WebDriver to open and render pages in these browsers.
- Captures full-page screenshots: The system should take a complete snapshot of the website, handling lazy-loaded images and content that loads on scroll.
- Waits for page load: The system should intelligently wait for the page to fully load before taking a screenshot. This includes handling JavaScript-heavy sites.
- Handles errors gracefully: If a website fails to load, times out, or blocks automated requests, the system should provide a clear error message rather than failing silently.
- Stores images efficiently: Screenshots should be saved in PNG or JPEG format, with filenames based on the website domain and timestamp for easy identification.
- No unnecessary delays: The system should be optimized for speed, capturing screenshots quickly without excessive processing.

### Acceptance Criteria:
**Given** a valid website URL is provided for screenshot capture,   
**Then** the system will successfully launch a browser session using WebDriver,   
**And** it will navigate to the provided URL without errors,   
**And** it will wait until the page has fully loaded before capturing a screenshot.   

**Given** a webpage contains dynamically loaded content or lazy-loaded images,   
**Then** the system should detect these elements and wait for them to be fully rendered,   
**And** it should use scrolling techniques to ensure all content is visible,   
**And** the captured screenshot should accurately reflect the complete page structure.   

**Given** the system has successfully captured a screenshot,   
**Then** the image should be saved in a structured directory,   
**And** the file format should be either PNG or JPEG,   
**And** the filename should include the website domain and a timestamp for easy identification.   

**Given** a website fails to load, times out, or blocks automated requests,   
**Then** the system should log an appropriate error message,   
**And** a fallback mechanism should attempt to capture a partial screenshot with a warning message,   
**And** the failure should not crash the entire application.   

**Given** the system has completed the screenshot capture process,   
**Then** the captured image should be accessible for retrieval,   
**And** the system should allow verification of the stored file,   
**And** it should ensure that no unnecessary delays occur in the process.   

### Tasks

- Write unit tests
- Write moq tests
- Write Jest tests
- Write Specflow tests
- Implement a method in WebScraperService to take a full-page screenshot.
- Use Selenium's JavaScriptExecutor to detect page height and scroll dynamically before capturing.
- Ensure screenshots capture lazy-loaded images and dynamically generated content.
- Save images in PNG/JPEG format with a structured filename.
- Implement a fallback mechanism:
    - If the page fails to load, attempt a partial screenshot.
    - Log appropriate error messages.
- Validate that screenshots are properly stored and retrievable.
