# Ux-14

## URL Submission and Analysis
### Story: 
> As a system, I want to be able to analyze the scraped site using OpenAI prompts so that we can find UX design flaws

### Assumptions/Preconditions
- Application is able to be started and runs
- URL is able to be submitted
- There is at least some web scrapped information.
- Some UX Categories are saved within the database for AI Prompts.

### Description
We want the scrapped information to be analyzed in multiple ways to gather as much information as possible. We want OpenAI to take care of figuring out specific information that things like Pa11y or Selenium might not be able to gather. OpenAI would be prompted to be given specific UX principles to work on and then any data scrapped will be sent to OpenAI. To keep things organized it shall take in information per UX principle the application is set up for.

### Acceptance Criteria:
**Scenario: Test Connection**   
**Given** I am the application   
**And** I ask OpenAI if it is receiving my message in yes or no format   
**Then** I should receive a yes   

**Scenario: OpenAI Processes Data**   
**Given** I am the application   
**And** a user submits a URL   
**And** the data is collected   
**When** I send the data to OpenAI   
**And** specific UX category prompts   
**Then** I should receive back UX insights   
**And** there are collected and stored per category   

**Scenario: Bad API Key**
**Given** I am the application   
**And** the OpenAI API key is missing or invalid   
**When** I send the data for analysis   
**Then** an error message should be logged   
**And** the user who submits URL should be notified of an error
