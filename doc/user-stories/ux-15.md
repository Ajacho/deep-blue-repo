## URL Submission and Analysis
### Story: 
> As a system, I should notify the user if the URL given is invalid, or unreachable

### Assumptions/Preconditions
- The MVC project has been set up.  
- A form for URL submission exists.  
- Backend validation logic is in place.  
- Error-handling mechanisms are configured. 

### Description
When a user submits a URL, the system should validate whether it is correctly formatted and reachable. If the URL is invalid (incorrect format) or the website is unreachable (e.g., server down, DNS failure), the system should provide clear and immediate feedback. This ensures users can correct mistakes and understand why a URL cannot be processed.  

The system will differentiate between an invalid URL and an unreachable site. Errors will be displayed dynamically on the UI without requiring a page refresh. Additionally, unreachable URL attempts will be logged for further review and debugging. 

### Acceptance Criteria:
**Given** a user submits an improperly formatted URL,  
**Then** the system detects and rejects it with an appropriate error message.  

**Given** a user submits a valid URL,  
**Then** the system attempts to reach it and determines whether it is accessible.  

**Given** a URL is unreachable (e.g., server down, DNS failure),  
**Then** the system provides a meaningful error message explaining the issue.  

**Given** an error occurs,  
**Then** the UI dynamically displays the message without requiring a page refresh.  

**Given** an unreachable URL is submitted,  
**Then** the system logs the attempt for further review. 
### Tasks
- Write unit tests for URL validation and error handling.    
- Write jest tests   
- Write Specflow testsImplement URL format validation.  
- Implement server reachability checks (e.g., HTTP response codes).  
- Update the UI to display error messages dynamically.  
- Ensure proper logging of errors for debugging and analytics.  
- Write JavaScript to handle real-time validation feedback.
