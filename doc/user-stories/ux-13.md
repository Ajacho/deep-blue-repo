## URL Submission and Analysis
### Story: 
> As a system, I want to be able to analyze the scraped site using Pa11y so that we can find accessibility errors

### Assumptions/Preconditions
- The system can process and store accessibility reports
- The website has already been scraped and is available for analysis

### Description
Analyzing the accessibility of a scraped website should be automated, efficient, and accurate. The system should allow for seamless execution of accessibility tests using Pa11y, without requiring manual configuration or intervention. This feature is designed to ensure that websites comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) by detecting common accessibility violations such as missing alt text, low contrast text, and improper heading structures.

The Pa11y integration will be fully automated, processing scraped websites and generating structured reports that can be stored, retrieved, and reviewed for accessibility improvements. These reports will provide insights into violations, severity levels, and suggested fixes to help developers and stakeholders improve website accessibility.

Here are the implementation details we've settled on after discussions with the development team:
- Automated accessibility analysis: The system will execute Pa11y scans on demand, analyzing the scraped website without requiring manual intervention.
- Detailed accessibility reports: The system will generate reports that include:
- A summary of total issues found.
- Issues categorized by severity (error, warning, notice).
- A timestamp indicating when the analysis was performed.
- Affected elements and their WCAG compliance codes.
- Optimized report storage: Accessibility reports will be stored in a structured format for easy retrieval and tracking.
- Error handling and validation: If the system encounters an issue, it will log the error and fail gracefully, ensuring that the analysis process does not crash.
- Preconfigured environment: The system will ensure that Node.js and Pa11y are installed and properly configured, preventing runtime errors.
- Test-driven approach: Unit tests will be written to validate Pa11y integration, report generation, and error handling, ensuring consistent functionality.
- Future-proofing: While this feature focuses on Pa11y integration, future iterations may include automated CI/CD accessibility checks and visual dashboards for report visualization.

### Acceptance Criteria:
**Given** the system is set up with Pa11y,   
**Then** I will confirm that Pa11y is installed and configured properly,   
**And** I will ensure that Pa11y can run without errors or configuration issues.   

**Given** I am reviewing the accessibility report,   
**Then** I will see a summary of total issues found,   
**And** I will see issues categorized by severity (e.g.,  error, warning, notice),   
**And** I will see a timestamp indicating when the analysis was performed.   

### Tasks

- Install Node.js (if not already installed).
- Install Pa11y globally using npm install -g pa11y.
- Write unit tests
- Write specflow tests
- Write jest tests
- Configure system settings to ensure compatibility with Pa11y and Node.js.
- Create a new AccessibilityController in the MVC application.
- Implement a RunPa11yAnalysis(string url) method to execute Pa11y against a given webpage.
- Ensure the method accepts a URL parameter, retrieves the corresponding scraped site, and triggers the Pa11y scan.
- Implement response handling to format the results into a structured JSON output.
- Log any errors encountered during the execution.
- Define a Pa11y report storage structure
- Save each report with a timestamped filename.
- Store key report details, including:
    - Total issues found
    - Severity categorization
    - Affected HTML elements and selectors
    - WCAG compliance codes and descriptions
- Implement retrieval functionality so reports can be queried and reviewed later.
- Implement error handling for:
    - Invalid URLs or missing scraped data.
    - Pa11y execution failures.
    - Network timeouts or inaccessible websites.
- Ensure the system logs errors without disrupting other processes.
- Return user-friendly error messages when analysis fails.
