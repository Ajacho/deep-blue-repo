### About Us

Inspired by the legendary supercomputer, Deep Blue, our team embodies the spirit of relentless learning and continuous improvement. Just as Deep Blue revolutionized its field by adapting, analyzing, and pushing boundaries, we strive to tackle challenges with the same innovative mindset. We aim to learn from every experience, evolve through collaboration, and persevere until we achieve our goals. *Every move counts.*

This project will serve as our senior capstone and demonstrate our capabilities in programming, web app development, and design. 

### Vision Statement 

The "UX Checkmate" web application helps developers, website owners, and designers enhance the accessibility and user experience of their webpages. By analyzing websites
for compliance with accessibility standards and UX principles, the app provides tailored,context-sensitive suggestions and visual mockups for improvement. Its goal is to ensure 
websites are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, while meeting ADA requirements for equal access to information and services.
